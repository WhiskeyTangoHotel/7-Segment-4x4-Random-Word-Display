7 Segment 4x4 Random Word Display

We were able to put 1,002 four letter words into the EPROM,  Since we display two four letter words selected at random that is over a 
million possible combinations.  The PICAXE random number generator is seeded by doing an analog read on an ADC open pin;   
basically we read 'noise' and use that for the seed.  It's pretty random, but I don't expect the method to be used in Vegas slot machines.

It's interesting to see the combinations produced by the rig.
